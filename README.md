# Sentence Reader - Algorithm

This program reads a sentence character by character and computes the following:  
- **Length of the sentence** (excluding the final period)  
- **Number of words** (words are counted based on spaces)  
- **Number of vowels** (both uppercase and lowercase)  

### How It Works:  
1. Reads characters until a period (`.`) is found  
2. Counts the total number of characters, spaces, and vowels.  
3. Adjusts the word count by adding 1 at the end.  
4. Outputs the results.
